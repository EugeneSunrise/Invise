## Spec

- .NET 6
- Clean WPF
- MVVM

## Architecture

The project is structured using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, which is common in WPF applications. The main components include:

- **ViewModels**: Classes such as `InviseBrowserViewModel`, `InviseProfilesViewModel`, and `BaseViewModel` that handle the logic and manage data for the UI.
- **Models**: Classes like `InviseProfile`, `ProxySettings`, `WebRTCSettings`, `Fingerprint`, and `IpInfoResult` that represent the application data.
- **Views**: XAML files like `InviseBrowserView.xaml` that define the UI.
- **Services**: Classes providing functionalities and settings, including `Setting`, `DelegateCommand`, `RelayCommand`, and UI components such as `AutoStackPanel` and `AutoGrid`.
- **Core**: Contains Chrome API related classes for handling requests, resources, lifespan settings, and models for configurations.
- **Scripts**: JavaScript files like `fakeinject.js` that are injected into web pages.
